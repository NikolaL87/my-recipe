Place loaf into a zippered gallon sized plastic bag and set out on counter to thaw. You can also place in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. Your dough should be thawed but still cold to the touch. Roll loaf into a 20-22-inch rope. Spray bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray. Form dough into a circle and place in the bottom of a sprayed bundt pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until double in size.",
